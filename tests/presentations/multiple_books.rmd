# This is the first page.
- It is automatically implemented, because the parent folder was passed in as an argument.

---


# This is the second page
- it is implemented too.
- every `.ipynb` file in a folder will be implemented alphabetically.
- other files will be ignored.
- before any other tags are used `new-page` has to be set first in every notebook. Calling `add-to-page` from a new notebook would raise an error. It is not possible to add / insert to a page of a different notebook.

---

# Some limitations
- It is not possible to change the ordering or exclude a file.

---


# This is a sub book

- It gets automatically implemented, if any root folder was passed as import argument.
- First all parent `.ipynb` files are implemented then the files in the folder.
