## Code with output.
```Python
def print_hello():
    print("hello")

print_hello()
```
```
hello

---

## Code ignore output.
```Python
def print_hello():
    print("hello")

print_hello()
```

---

## Show only output.
```
hello
```

## Code with error
```Python
def add_one(number):
    return number + 1

print(f"1 + 1 = {add_one(1)}")
print(f"1 + 'error' = {add_one('error')}")
```
```
1 + 1 = 2
```
```
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

## Code ignore error
```Python
def add_one(number):
    return number + 1

print(f"1 + 1 = {add_one(1)}")
print(f"1 + 'error' = {add_one('error')}")
```
```

## Only error

## Implement of unsaved images is not possible
```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1,2], [3,4])
plt.show()
```

# This is the first page.
- It is automatically implemented, because the parent folder was passed in as an argument.

---


# This is the second page
- it is implemented too.
- every `.ipynb` file in a folder will be implemented alphabetically.
- other files will be ignored.
- before any other tags are used `new-page` has to be set first in every notebook. Calling `add-to-page` from a new notebook would raise an error. It is not possible to add / insert to a page of a different notebook.

---

# Some limitations
- It is not possible to change the ordering or exclude a file.

---


# This is a sub book

- It gets automatically implemented, if any root folder was passed as import argument.
- First all parent `.ipynb` files are implemented then the files in the folder.
