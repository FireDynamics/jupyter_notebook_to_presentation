# This is the first page.
- It is automatically implemented, because the parent folder was passed in as an argument.

---

# This is the second page
- it is implemented too.
- every `.ipynb` file in a folder will be implemented alphabetically.
- other files will be ignored.
- before any other tags are used `new-page` has to be set first in every notebook. Calling `add-to-page` from a new notebook would raise an error. It is not possible to add / insert to a page of a different notebook.

---

# Some limitations
- It is not possible to change the ordering or exclude a file.

---

# This is a sub book

- It gets automatically implemented, if any root folder was passed as import argument.
- First all parent `.ipynb` files are implemented then the files in the folder.

---

class: topic

# This book should demonstrate the page class
- there fore this page is the class `topic`

---

class: rotate

## This Page has a different class
- the class in questioning is `rotate`

---

class: rotate

# The tags will override each other
- first will set the page to `topic`
- but change it to `rotate`
- the `class[...]` tag changes the latest page topic
